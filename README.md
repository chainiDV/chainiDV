### About me
I started coding in 2016 and since then I've used several languages for my projects. In 2017 I gave FiveM a try by creating a server, which reached 100k registered users within a year, PoPLife.

- 📲 Currently looking forward to collaborating with open source projects and to developing private FiveM scripts.
- 💻 I've used in my projects: JS (+ NodeJS), Java, C#, C, C++, Assembler, Lua, HTML, CSS, Python, VueJS and React.
- 🌐 I love new technologies and learning them.
